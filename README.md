# Game-Of-Life
This project lets you play around with the famous game of life algorithm in your console. 
You can resize the area, create random starting patterns or alternatively use some template patterns that I have included. 
The image will be output to the console and every iteration of the algorithm will be visibly tracked. It's quite mesmerizing to watch.

Demonstration of random starting patterns:
